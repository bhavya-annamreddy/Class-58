        <p>My Name is Bhavya Annamreddy. I was born on December 11th, 2007 in New Jersey, USA to Vidya and Sasidhar Annamreddy. I have a younger brother, Hithav Annamreddy. We work on Youtube videos together with my mom. Me and my mom come up with ideas and write them out and my brother does speaking. I am also a middle schooler at Mercer Middle School. I am in the 7th Grade. I like reading, drawing and watching anime as well!</p>
